Project Breathe
===============

Project Breathe is a project to keep track of the speed-related improvements in Semplice 6 and later.

What you mean with 'speed'?
---------------------------

With 'speed' we do not only mean the bare performance of the distribution, but also the amount of time and work is needed on the user's part to get things done.

A goal of Project Breathe is to optimize user interfaces to get things done, faster.

Is Project Breathe Semplice 6-related?
--------------------------------------

No, it isn't. We can't get perfection with only a six-month timeline.  
And we will not reach perfection, ever.  
But we want to get closer and closer to it with every release.
